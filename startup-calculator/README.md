# Finance Forecasting Model
This script forecasts your future finances based on current cash position, growth rate, revenue, and costs.

Using pandas, it tries to answer two questions:

1. The most conservative scenario: if you fail to grow at all from this point, when you will run out of money and die? 
2. If you continue to grow at your current rate, when you will run out of money and die?

"Running out of money" is actually defined as having less than 25,000 in the bank, as this is presumed to be the minimum amount to wind down the company in a suitable fashion.
